# 前言
[Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis) 是一項由美國Instacart公司在Kaggle上發起的資料競賽，主要是希望透過大數據分析的方式，來預測顧客下筆訂單中會出現的商品。由於競賽還未結束的關係，因此先簡單介紹我已經開源的方法，日後競賽結束我也會整理相關文件，再將經驗記錄下來。

# 競賽說明

{% blockquote 競賽說明 https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/ 競賽說明 %}

Whether you shop from meticulously planned grocery lists or let whimsy guide your grazing, our unique food rituals define who we are. Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it easy to fill your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. After selecting products through the Instacart app, personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you.

Instacart’s data science team plays a big part in providing this delightful shopping experience. Currently they use transactional data to develop models that predict which products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session. Recently, Instacart open sourced this data - see their blog post on 3 Million Instacart Orders, Open Sourced.

In this competition, Instacart is challenging the Kaggle community to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order. They’re not only looking for the best model, Instacart’s also looking for machine learning engineers to grow their team.

Winners of this competition will receive both a cash prize and a fast track through the recruiting process. For more information about exciting opportunities at Instacart, check out their careers page here or e-mail their recruiting team directly at ml.jobs@instacart.com.
